# TSP Heuristic Tour Finder

This project aims to find a near-optimal solution for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using a heuristic approach. Given the NP-hard nature of TSP, the method focuses on achieving the best possible result rather than an exact solution. The algorithm begins by reading city data from an input file, applying K-means clustering to divide the cities into two clusters. It then calculates the center coordinates and weights of these clusters. The main selection algorithm iteratively expands a square region around the cluster centers to select cities, ensuring that half of the cities are visited. The total travel distance is computed using the Euclidean distance formula, and the results, including the distance and the sequence of visited cities, are written to an output file. This approach balances efficiency and accuracy by leveraging clustering and iterative selection.
